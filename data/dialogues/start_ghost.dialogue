"woo ... ...|... woo ..." "... sword ...|tree ... fast..."
"The sword... It's like a portal to the afterlife|You can hear me now ..." "I need your help, those slimes won't leave us, ghosts, alone" "Can you take care of this problem?|Kill those slimes on the east of the village."
"Thank you for those slimes. I don't know where their nest is. If only I could destroy it..." "Maybe the nest is in the mine near your house.|I believe you can make your way through the bushes|at the entrance of the mine by using your sword."
"What is that in your pocket?" "Ohhh I see, this key looks familiar to me." "I'm pretty sure it can open this|old door at the north of the village."
"You did it! You actually did it!!|I don't know how to thank you.|Those slimes won't be a problem anymore."
